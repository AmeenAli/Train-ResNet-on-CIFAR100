# Train-ResNet-on-CIFAR100

A very deep Residual neural network proposed by He et al. (2015) was used for training on CIFAR100 dataset using Pytorch. In Resnet.py the model achieved an accuracy over 60%. In Resnet_pretr.py a ResNet18 pretrained model was used for image classification. Using transfer learning, the model was able to achieve an accuracy over 70%.
